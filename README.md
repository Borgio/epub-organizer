# Epub Organizer 

This project is created to compare different MongoDB clients and mappers. It currently consists of the following frameworks:

* `Spring Data - MongoDB` - Spring Data powered ORM.
* `Morphia` - A mature but sleeping ORM. I've used a fork.
* `MongoClient` - The Java driver for MongoDB
* `MongoJack` - If I can get it to work :)

The ORM mappers / clients are organized in packages, and share some common structures. 

Running `gradle test` should run all the test with default settings against your local database, and it should not fail. It works on my machine! ;)

### Why did you do this?

Because I asked a question on Stackoverflow, but it was closed due to being to subjective. So I had to find out myself. Feel free to fork / clone / copy and use however you'd like.

### You did it wrong!

Great! Let me know how I can improve things, so I can update the code and others will benefit too! Open an issue or submit a pull request! I'd love to learn from you!!
