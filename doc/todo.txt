TODO:
- Fix tests: in case of P. L. Travers, use Travers as lastname.                     DONE
- Rename *extractor to *strategy FileNameAuthorStrategy (better, I guess?)          DONE
- Add metadata parser for author                                                    DONE
- Choose right author based on highest score                                        DONE
- Springify                                                                         DONE
- Added book context for faster loading                                             DONE
- Create sifting appender per book                                                  DONE
- Add profiles to make dataset switchable                                           DONE
- Added code coverage                                                               DONE
- Make titlescorer and authorscorer and languagescoring generic                     DONE
- Improve authorscorer to read the txt files with names

- Need to create a proper test epub with following characteristics to use for testing (dummybook.epub)
  - Good author name
  - Good title
  - Good language
  - Isbn10 + Isbn13
  - Small cover image (max 5kb)

- Store all book data in bookproducer
- Extract content from book
- Add tag (eg gutenberg) to all books imported from gutenberg

Later:

- Upgrade to Java 8?
- Replace Start.threadPool with @Async stuff??
- Make strategies pluggable (SPIs?)


Bugs:

- Saving books always adds a new one, instead of updating it.
- Fix testBookProducerTest: should detected firstname: W. H., and lastname 'Davenport Adams'
